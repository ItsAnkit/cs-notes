Incremental Garbage collection -

Heap compaction - using two fingers approach.

Webpack, on the other hand, fully embraces the concept of JavaScript modules. It integrates with Babel, PostCSS, and just about any recent web framework. It supports a number of module syntaxes, including dynamic imports for code splitting.
There are a wide variety of configurable source map options. Top to bottom, the webpack compilation process is extremely modular and customizable.


I want to use a proper JavaScript module system to manage dependencies,
I want to take advantage of the cutting edge features from ES6+, Babel,
I want intelligent code-splitting features such as dynamic imports and webpack's splitChunks optimization

dup is a shallow copy while clone is complete copy


super - sends all arguments
super() - no arguments
