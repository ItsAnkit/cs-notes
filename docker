Container - 
   This is a process running on top of the Linux kernel. It is allocated its own resources: CPU, memory, and filesystem.
   image becomes container when write functionality is added to it.


Docker containers share your host’s kernel, and isolation is done using cgroups and other linux kernel libraries.


Securing containers - 
Don’t run containers with root level access
Don’t store credentials within the container.
Check and manage runtime privilege and Linux capabilities
Use security tools.
Consider private registries


Optimizing Your Docker Environment -
CPU Share Constraint.
Block IO bandwidth (Blkio) constraint. 
Constrain Memory Usage.
