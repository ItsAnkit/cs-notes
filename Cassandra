        C is also called partioning key 

Compound Primary Key
    Primary key(C1, C2 . . .)
        C1 is the partioning key and C2 is clustering key

    Primary key((C1, C2), C3 . . .)
        C1, C2 are the compound partioning key and C3 is clustering key

With Clause
    to specify any property and its value for the defined table. For compressing table data.

Drop Table KeyspaceName.TableName

Alter table keyspace.table

Drop ColumnName |
Rename ColumnName To NewColumnName |
With propertyName=PropertyValue
